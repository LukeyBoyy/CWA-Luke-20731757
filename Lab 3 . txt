Exercise 1 --
When doing 'let' to a variable you are able to change the variable to another thing without using let.

for example;
let var1 =22
var1 = 22

then if i wanted to change the variable I could just do 
var1 =25

whereas

When using 'const' to a variable, you are unable to change it after it has been assigned without using const again

for example;
const y = 44
y = 44

then if i tried to change it like this 
y = 22
it would not let me.
