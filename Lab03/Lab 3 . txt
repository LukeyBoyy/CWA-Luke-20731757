Exercise 1 --
When doing 'let' to a variable you are able to change the variable to another thing without using let.

for example;
let var1 =22
var1 = 22

then if i wanted to change the variable I could just do 
var1 =25

whereas

When using 'const' to a variable, you are unable to change it after it has been assigned without using const again

for example;
const y = 44
y = 44

then if i tried to change it like this 
y = 22
it would not let me.

Exercise 2--
let arr1 = ['c','b','a'];
let arr2 = [1,2,3];

arr1.reverse();

let resultArray = arr1.concat(arr2);

let resultString = resultArray.join('');

console.log(resultString);

Exercise 3 --
let person = {
    name: "Luke",
    introduce: function() {
        return 'Hello, my name is ${this.name}
    }
};

console.log(person.introduce());

Exercise 4 --
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cthulhu'];
let greetings = names.map(name => 'Hello " + name + '!');
console.log(greetings);
